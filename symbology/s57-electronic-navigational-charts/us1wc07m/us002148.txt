Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area.  
Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that 
were originally buried may have become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme caution when 
operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and 
cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.
