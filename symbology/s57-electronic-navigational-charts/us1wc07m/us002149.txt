Maritime boundary provisionally applied pending formal exchange of instruments of ratification.
According to Article 3 of the Agreement Between the United States of America and Russia on the 
Maritime Boundary, signed June 1, 1990:
"1.  In any area east of the maritime boundary that lies within 200 nautical miles of the baseline 
from which the breadth of the territorial sea of Russia is measured but beyond 200 nautical miles 
of the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of the United States is measured ("eastern special area").  
Russia agrees that henceforth the United States may exercise the sovereign rights and jurisdiction derived from 
exclusive economic zone jurisdiction that Russia would otherwise be entitled to exercise under international law 
in the absence of the agreement of the Parties on the maritime boundary...
3.  to the extent that either Party exercises the sovereign rights or jurisdiction in the special area or areas on its 
side of the maritime boundary as provided for in this Article, such exercise of sovereign rights or jurisdiction derives 
from the agreement of the Parties and does not constitute an extension of its exclusive economic zone.  To this end, 
each Party shall take the necessary steps to ensure that any exercise on its part of such rights or jurisdiction in 
the special area or areas on its side of the maritime boundary shall be so characterized in its relevant laws, regulations, 
and charts."
